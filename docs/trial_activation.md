A trial will allow you to test all available features in XOA, for 15 days.

The procedure is very simple:

* register, then download a Free Edition [on our website](https://xen-orchestra.com/#/member)
* [deploy the virtual appliance](xoa.md)
* activate the trial via the "Update" view (details below)

## Activate the trial

In your current Free XOA, register it in the "Updates" view in the main menu:

> **Don't worry! XOA will still work after the trial: you'll be forced to downgrade to Free version, but you won't lose any configuration data.**
