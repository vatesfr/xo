# Others

We already have other modules in place, e.g for authentication, like a LDAP, SAML, Google or GitHub as external providers.

If you want to understand how modules work, have a look here:

* [LDAP plugin](https://github.com/vatesfr/xen-orchestra/tree/master/packages/xo-server-auth-ldap)
* [GitHub authentication](https://github.com/vatesfr/xen-orchestra/tree/master/packages/xo-server-auth-github)

XO's API can be explored through the `xo-cli` client (please refer to the previous section for details).

There are modules for a lot of various tasks, like:

* performance analysis
* reporting
* load management
* various authentication providers

Check your Settings/Plugins view in XOA to see them.
