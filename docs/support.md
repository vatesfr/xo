# Support

You can access our pro support if you subscribe to any of these plans:

* Starter
* Enterprise
* Premium

The better the plan, the faster the support will be with higher priority.

## Community support

If you are using Xen Orchestra via the sources, you can ask questions and try to recieve help two different ways:

* In our [forum](https://xen-orchestra.com/forum/)
* In our IRC - `#xen-orchestra` on `Freenode`

However, there's no guarantee you will receive an answer and no guaranteed response time. If you are using XO from sources, we encourage you to give back to the community by assisting other users via these two avenues as well.  

If you are using Xen Orchestra in production, please subscribe to a plan.

## Open a ticket

If you have a subscription, you can open a ticket describing your issue directly from your personal account page [here](https://xen-orchestra.com/#!/member/support)
