# Editions

There are 4 **editions** of the Xen Orchestra Appliance (XOA):

* Free
* Starter
* Enterprise
* Premium

**Also, you can try all features in the Premium Edition for free (without any commitment) for 15 days by registering a trial. [Read here for trial instructions](trial.md).**

### Free

This is the basic edition, allowing you to perform administrator tasks on a virtualized infrastructure. It's "like" XenCenter. You can:

* Create VMs, SRs etc.
* Access to VM consoles (HTML5 web based!)
* Edit resources (VM, pools etc.)
* Make snapshots
* Migrate VMs

That's more or less the same features you can see on the [administration page](administration.md).

### Starter

The Starter Edition is intended for system administrators who want to do more with their current XenServer infrastructure. This version is also bundled with our pro support!

In addition to the free edition, you get:

* [Scheduled backups](full_backups.md)
* [Scheduled snapshots](rolling_snapshots.md)
* Patch detection and application in one click (even to whole pools at once!)
* XenServer Docker management via XenServer plugin

You'll also have access to our ticket system to report issues and be helped in less than 72h.

### Enterprise

The Enterprise Edition allows you to access a lot more features than Starter:

* Disaster Recovery
* Continuous Delta Backup
* Live stats
* ACLs + LDAP/SSO

In addition, you'll have faster support to answer your issues/questions (48h or less).

### Premium

Premium is the highest edition, with all features included without any limitations. This means:

* Dataviz
* Infrastructure health check
* Job Manager
* Continuous Replication
* Self Service

Along with the fastest guaranteed support - 24 hours or less (typically much less).
