# XOSAN types

There is 2 modes for creating an XOSAN storage. They are different and the choice is done forever. You can't **switch from a mode to another** when XOSAN is created, except by removing and re-creating it.

That's why it's **very important to understand pros and cons** of each type.

> On "top" of there 2 types, you can also deciding to spread all operations to multiple number of volumes. This is called **distributed** mode. It's very similar to *RAID 0*, which can be placed on top of a *RAID 1* for example. We'll talk about it in the end of this guide.

Here is those 2 types:

* [Replicated](xosan_replicated.md)
* [Disperse](xosan_replicated.md)
