# Visualizations

Visualizations can help you to understand your XenServer infrastructure, as well as correlate events and detect bottlenecks.

### Dashboard

The dashboard view gathers information on all your connected pools/hosts.

> You can also update all your hosts (install missing patches) from this page.

### Parallel Coordinates

A Parallel Coordinates visualization helps to detect proportions in a hierarchical environment. In a XenServer environment, it's especially useful if you want to see useful information from a large amount of data.
