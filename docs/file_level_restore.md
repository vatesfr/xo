# File level restore

You can also restore individual files inside a VM. It works with all your existing delta backups.

> You must use the latest XOA release. When you connect with the console, you should see `Build number: 16.12.20`. If you have this or higher (eg `17.*`), it means that's OK! Otherwise, please update your XOA.

> Restoring individual files from an SMB remote is not yet possible, but it's planned for the future!

> File level restore **is only possible on delta backups**
